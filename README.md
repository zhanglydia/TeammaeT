## Recursive Abstraction
When I am asked to return the Boolean value of the statement
"the maze is navigable, having a legal travel path from current position to existing treasure",
the recursive can return the Boolean value of the statement "the maze is navigable, having a legal travel path from current position to existing treasure" given starting moves.

## Base Case
The current position is a treasure or there are no legal moves.
