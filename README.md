## Recursive Abstraction
When I am asked to return the Boolean value of the statement
"the maze is navigable, having a legal travel path from start point to existing treasure",

the recursive can return the Boolean value of the statement "the maze is navigable, having a legal travel path from start point to existing treasure" given starting moves.
